## Architecture Flowchart

![Moderation Flowchart](./flowchat.jpg)

**Description:**  
1. **Teams Trigger:** Listens for new messages in a specific Teams channel.
2. **Logic App:** Checks message content for keywords ("profanity", "inappropriate", "threat").
3. **Email Notification:** Sends an alert to the administrator if a violation is detected.

---

## Logic App Workflow Description

- **Trigger:**  
  - *When a new message is added to a chat or channel* (Microsoft Teams connector)
  - Configured for:  
    - **Team:** CST8917Assignment3-test  
    - **Channel:** General

- **For each message:**  
  - **Get message details** using the messageId, teamId, and channelId from the trigger.
  - **Condition:**  
    - Checks if the message content (plain text) contains any of the following keywords (case-insensitive):  
      - `profanity`
      - `inappropriate`
      - `threat`
  - **If violation detected:**  
    - **Send an email (V2)** to the administrator (congzhao2009@gmail.com) with details of the sender and message.

- **No optional/advanced features** (Azure Functions or Cognitive Services) were implemented, as only the basic requirements were completed.

---

## Testing & Results

- **Test Method:**  
  - Sent various messages in the specified Teams channel, including both clean and violating content.
  - Example violating message:  
    - `This message contains profanity and should trigger the email.`

- **Expected Result:**  
  - If a message contains any of the keywords, an email notification is sent to the administrator.

- **Actual Result:**  
  - The Logic App successfully detected violations and sent email notifications as expected.

## Challenges & Solutions

- **Teams Connector Output Structure:**  
  - The output structure sometimes caused confusion (array vs. object). Solution: Used `items('For_each')?['messageId']` etc. in the For each loop.
- **No Message Content in Get message details:**  
  - Used the `plainTextContent` field for reliable keyword detection.
- **Designer Auto-Adding For each:**  
  - Accepted the For each and configured all actions inside it using the correct expressions.
- **htmlToText() Not Supported:**  
  - Used `plainTextContent` instead of trying to convert HTML to text.

---

## Future Improvements

- Add logging or dashboard for moderation events.
- Support for multiple channels or teams.
- Customizable keyword list via configuration.
- Integrate **Azure Cognitive Services for Language** for more advanced content analysis (optional enhancement).
